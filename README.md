# RockPaperScissor

This is a simple game of Rock-Paper-Scissors that can be played between a player and a computer. The game consists of five rounds, and the first player to win three rounds is declared the winner.

## Getting Started
To run the game, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python installed, simply download the "game.py" file from this repository and save it to your preferred directory.

## Playing the Game
To play the game, open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the **"game.py"** file is saved. Then, type the following command to start the game:

-> **python game.py**

The game will then start and prompt you to enter your choice for each round. You can choose between **"rock"**, **"paper"**, or **"scissors"** by typing it and hitting enter.

After each round, the program will display the current score and prompt you to enter your choice for the next round. Once the game is over (after five rounds), the program will declare the winner and ask if you want to play again.

## Acknowledgments
This program was created as a simple exercise in Python programming. Feel free to modify and build upon this code to create your own games and applications.
